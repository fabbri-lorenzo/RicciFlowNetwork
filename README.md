# Community Detection on Networks using Ricci Flow
This repository implements community detection on **Zachary's Karate Club graph** using **Discrete Ricci Flow**, based on the methodology presented in the paper ["Community Detection on Networks with Ricci Flow"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46380-9) by Chien-Chun Ni et al.

This is a project for the course on Complex Networks of the University of Bologna.
The essay for the exam can be found [here](latex/DiscreteRicciFlow.pdf)
