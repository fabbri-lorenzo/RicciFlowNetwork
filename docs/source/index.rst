RicciFlowNetwork's Documentation
============================================
In this project, we apply Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Ricci Flow to detect the two known communities in Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club graph. 
In the test modules one can apply the method to two different synthetic graphs to verify its correct behavior. It is also possible to compare the performances of OTD and ATD methods for computing curvature.
