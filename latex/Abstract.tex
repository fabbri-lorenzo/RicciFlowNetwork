    This project uses Ricci Flow as a geometric approach to detect community structures in networks. It applies Ollivier-Ricci curvature to adjust the weights of edges in a graph, iterating the process to shrink intra-community edges and stretch inter-community edges. Planar graphs with different community structures are used as datasets, with the goal of identifying pre-labelled communities using the Ricci Flow method.
