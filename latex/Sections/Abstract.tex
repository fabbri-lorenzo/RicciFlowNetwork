    This project uses Ricci Flow as a geometric approach to detect community structures in networks. It applies Ollivier-Ricci curvature to adjust the weights of edges in a graph, iterating the process to shrink intra-community edges and stretch inter-community edges. Having tested the Ricci Flow method, our goal was identifying the pre-labelled communities of a real dataset: Zachary's Karate Club graph \cite{ZacharyKarateClubGraph}.
