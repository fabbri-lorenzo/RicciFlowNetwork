Before applying Ricci Flow in a complex network context, let us briefly turn to string theory and topology to appreciate its historical and mathematical significance. As discussed in the previous chapter, Ricci Flow was instrumental in proving the Poincar√© Conjecture, which we introduce shortly. Moreover, the string-theoretic sigma model provides a concrete instance of Ricci Flow, and we will analyse this next.
