\section{Tests on Synthetic Graphs}\label{sec5.2}
\subsection{Stochastic Block Model Test Graph}
To start testing our code we choose a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) graph. An SBM graph is a type of random graph model used to generate networks with a predefined community structure. It is an extension of the Erdos--R\'enyi, where nodes are divided into communities, and the probability of an edge between two nodes depends on their community membership. It is characterized by \textit{N} nodes, \textit{k} communities and a connectivity matrix \textit{$P_{ij}$} which represents the probability of an edge between a node in community $i$ and a node in community $j$.
Since communities are predefined when generating the graph, we can directly compare the detected communities with the true ones.

For our test we set 
\begin{equation*}
    N = 500, \quad k = 2, \quad
    P =
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        0.20 & 0.03 \\
        0.03 & 0.20
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
with every initial weight equal to one.

Curvature values for the initial SBM graph are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:SBM_comparison_a}, while on the right we have the updated curvatures after 10 iterations of Ricci Flow. We can see that the community structure of this graph is already well established; Ricci Flow has however highlighted the weak connection of central inter community nodes as one can see in fig.~\ref{fig:SBM_comparison_b}.

\end{figure}

In fig.~\ref{fig:SBM_Accuracy} we see that surgery with a cutoff between 1 and $\approx$1.5 leads to a perfect distinction between the two communities, i.e., an ARI of 1.

\end{figure}

Lastly, fig.~\ref{fig:SBM_Communities_a} depicts the graph after surgery with a cutoff between 1 and $\approx$1.5. As expected, we got a separation into two distinct clusters. Fig.~\ref{fig:SBM_Communities_b} shows the two communities corresponding to the two connected components.

\subsection{Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi Test Graph}
As a more complex synthetic graph for testing we used a Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) benchmark graph. LFR graphs are widely used for testing community-detection algorithms because they produce networks with heterogeneous (scale-free) degree distributions and community-size distributions, making them more realistic than simpler models. Nodes are assigned to communities according to specified power-law exponents, and a “mixing” parameter controls the fraction of edges that connect different communities.

For our test we built a graph with 500 nodes $\bigl(n = 500\bigr)$ with a degree distribution exponent $\tau_{1} = 3$ and a community-size exponent $\tau_{2} = 1.5$. For the mixing parameter we chose $\mu = 0.2$ indicates a relatively strong community structure by limiting the proportion of inter-community edges. We set each community to have a minimum of 20 nodes and a maximum of 70 nodes. The expected average degree is set to 20, with a maximum node degree capped at 50. 

For this graph we applied 40 iterations of Ricci Flow as its structure is more complex than the previous SBM graph (see fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_comparison_a}). In fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_comparison_b} we see a convergence of the curvature values after Ricci Flow; the high number of nodes and communities makes difficult to visualize properly the graph, for this reason we introduced also a histogram plot of weights and curvature values in the final code implementation for the Karate club graph (see \autoref{sec5.3}).

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Comparison of LFR graph before and after having applied 40 iterations of  Ricci Flow on edges.}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_Accuracy} shows the behaviour of ARI and modularity depending on the chosen cutoff point. Also in this case we see that it is possible to obtain an ARI of 1.

    \label{fig:LFR_Accuracy}
\end{figure}

In fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_Surgery} we have the graph after surgery (we chose as cutoff $\approx$1.12 to get an ARI of 1) and we can see that it got divided into connected components with all the nodes of the same colour, i.e., same community. In this case we did not produce a plot community by community due to the high number of clusters.

        \label{fig:LFR_Surgery}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional Tests on Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi Graphs}
As a final test for our code we decided to try reproducing a result presented in the work of Ni et al. (see \textit{figure 8a} at page 12 of~\cite{Ni:communitydetectionnetworksricci}). In particular, it is about applying Ricci Flow on different LFR graphs differing for the modularity parameter $\mu$ and the average degree. Of course one expects the ARI to decrease with increasing values of $\mu$ as the community structure becomes less defined.

In fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_OTD} we present our results with OTD method for curvature evaluation. ARI decreases with increasing $\mu$ as expected and does not show significant differences between different values of average degree.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../tests/LFRResults/LFR_OTD.png}
    \caption{LFR OTD.}
    \label{fig:LFR_OTD}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, fig.~\ref{fig:LFR_ATD} shows a much poorer performance and the choice of the average degree seems to be more relevant. This is in accordance with ATD method being faster than OTD, but also less precise.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../tests/LFRResults/LFR_ATD.png}
    \caption{LFR ATD.}
    \label{fig:LFR_ATD}
\end{figure}

Our graphs do not match exactly the plots of Ni et al., as for them the loss of ARI starts from higher values of $\mu$. This could be for various reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is unclear which parameter they used to generate LFR graphs. For example, using NetworkX it is not possible to control exactly the number of communities (only a minimum and maximum number can be set), so they probably generated their graphs differently, fixing some parameters we did not have complete control on.
    \item They used an average ARI, probably generating the same graph multiple times. We generated the graph and applied the Ricci Flow just once due to an already high execution time.
    \item Their surgery process is not specified in detail. They might have used multiple surgeries over the same Ricci Flow process to remove possible singularities affecting the final performance (even though this should not be the case for this kind of graph).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Times}
To conclude our testing part, we added some test performed on a LFR graph with fixed mixing parameter $\mu=0.20$ and average degree of 20. 
We compared execution times for OTD and ATD methods applied to the same LFR graph, looking at the behaviour and stability for incresing iteration number in the Ricci Flow process.
First we used a graph made up of $n$=500 nodes (fig.~\ref{fig:times_500}), in which we can see that ATD takes more iterations to converge and its performance is by no means comparable with the better OTD method. Even advantages in execution times for ATD are small and not consistent.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../tests/LFRResults/Exe_times_LFR_500_nodes.png}
    \caption{LFR execution times and ARI comparison between OTD and ATD methods for $n$=500.}
    \label{fig:times_500}
\end{figure}

Then we set $n$=1000 and from fig.~\ref{fig:times_1000} we can see that the results are quite similar to the previous case but with an higher ARI for ATD method. Of course overall execution times increase with higher $n$ as expected.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../tests/LFRResults/Exe_times_LFR_1000_nodes.png}
    \caption{LFR execution times and ARI comparison between OTD and ATD methods for $n$=1000.}
    \label{fig:times_1000}
\end{figure}

Lastly, we tested on a much bigger graph having $n$=2500, results are given in fig.~\ref{fig:times_2500}. Here we see a significant difference in execution times when the Ricci Flow is performed with 30 iterations.
ATD is more than a minute slower even thought its ARI has already converged. This is a bit unexpected but it might be due to the complexity of the graph with such a high number of nodes. Probably ATD does not succeed in 
making the graph structure converge and continues (unsuccessfully) updating curvatures consuming execution time. Again, the higher ARI of ATD for few iterations numbers can be explained as the method having updated the graph few times and so its original structure is still preserved at some level.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../tests/LFRResults/Exe_times_LFR_2500_nodes.png}
    \caption{LFR execution times and ARI comparison between OTD and ATD methods for $n$=2500.}
    \label{fig:times_2500}
\end{figure}

From this analysis we can say that ATD takes in general more iterations to converge and is more unstable if compared with OTD.
As expected, ATD never performs better than OTD, what surprised us was ATD execution time, especially for the graph with $n=2500$.
We expected ATD to be faster with more consistence, even thought the behaviour could be explained as ATD is best suited for simple graph structures and thus might suffer when one has a graph with a high number of nodes.
