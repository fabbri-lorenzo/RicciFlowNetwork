\section{Application to Zachary's Karate Club Graph}
\label{sec5.3}

Zachary’s Karate Club is a classic social network collected by Wayne Zachary in the 1970s \cite{ZacharyKarateClubGraph}. It represents the relationships among 34 members of a university karate club, where each node is a person and an edge indicates some kind of social interaction (e.g., friendship or frequent contact) between two members. During the study, the karate club split into two factions due to an internal dispute, effectively dividing the network into two communities.

Therefore, our goal was to apply the Ricci Flow method to the graph in order to identify these two distinct communities.
Fig.~\ref{fig:Karate_comparison_graphs_a} is a plot of the initial graph as loaded from Netwrokx, with edges'colors based on curvature values. In contrast, fig.~\ref{fig:Karate_comparison_graphs_b} shows the same graph after Ricci Flow process, with updated curvature values.

As anticipated in the previous section, we added a histogram visualization for a better glimpse on curvatures and also on weights values. The original Ricci curvatueres and weights can be seen in fig.~\ref{fig:Karate_comparison_histo_a}, while the updated ones are in in fig.~\ref{fig:Karate_comparison_histo_b}.

In addition to plotting ARI and modularity with various cutoff thresholds, we also wanted to check the result produced by guessing the cut looking at modularity drops. In fig.~\ref{fig:Karate_Accuracy} the "good cut" guessed as the one corresponding to the maximum before a modularity drop is depicted in red. As we hoped for, it also corresponds to the maximum of ARI, confirming that the method can be still useful in cases in which ground truth is not available.
