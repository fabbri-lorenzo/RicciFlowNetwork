%**************** CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS CHAPTER ******************

Future directions could include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploring \emph{Forman-Ricci} curvature or other discrete curvature notions to see how they compare in community detection or anomaly detection tasks.
    \item Combining \emph{higher-order} or \emph{simplicial} network topologies, in which edges, triangles, and higher-dimensional simplices each carry a curvature notion, potentially refining the detection of substructures.
    \item Investigating multi-scale or hierarchical surgery, systematically refining each sub-community using iterative curvature-based updates.
\end{itemize}

All of these highlight that curvature-based community detection offers a distinctive geometric lens on networks, bridging rich ideas from differential geometry to the realm of data science and large-scale graph analysis.
